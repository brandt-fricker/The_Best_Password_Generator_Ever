# The_Best_Password_Generator_Ever
This project emphasizes the use of Javascript to generate a random password, with a prompt to add a user selected length, confirmations of the use of lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers, and special characters.  

Once the user selects the desired inputs of their password, a password will be generated on the screen for the user to copy, and logged into the console if the user wishes to get it from there instead.
